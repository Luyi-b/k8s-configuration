REQUIREMENTS GATHERING
- Company Business: Book selling E-commerce (Web application)
- Plan to scale to infinite - Kubernetes (I suggest fully managed e.g. EKS)
	- replicaset
	- cluster autoscaling (desired, maximum, minimum nodes)
	- Monitoring for need to autoscale
- Application stack (React - Frontend) & (NodeJS - Backend) 
	 - Package with npm (Node Package Manager) 
- Take app from local to fully scalable cloud infra solution (DevOps end-to-end lifecycle - morning devotion)
- Cloud provider - AWS
- Design automated CI/CD pipeline (Jenkins declarative pipeline)
- Github will have 3 branches - Dev, Staging & Prod
	- Assign access to developers to commit their codes to Github
	- Create a Staging branch from which you would pull the code into your pipeline for deployment
	- Create a Prod branch which would be the main production branch and if changes need to be made, should be made on test or staging
	- You can use Git merge command to update your repositories from test. 
- Monitor infrastructure (Prometheus, Grafana, AWS Cloudwatch)
	- Use helm charts to install Prometheus, Grafana
	- Configure AWS cloudwatch (& another service) to monitor the health of the systems
	- Infrasturcture will report issues to slack/email
- Security & data protection is a priority (credentialing, AWS IAM, Backing up & snapshots)
	- Sonarqube for data vulnerability scanning etc
- Being on budget is a prime necessity (Ensure your systems deployed is as minimal as possible 		but ready to scale at the slightest increase in traffic)
- 

PLAN
- How to implement the solution
- Specificity of tools & systems (Ensure you talk about EKS, Terraform etc)
- Networking - VPC provisioning
- Diagrams/ Flowchart
-
